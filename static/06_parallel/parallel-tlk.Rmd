## What is Parallel processing? {.columns-2}

Is a type of computation in which many calculations or process are carried out simultaneously.

## Parallel Packages in R

How we do this?

Multi Core Processors. Computers today have multiple cores on them.

-   `Parallel` [R Baseline]
-   `Rmpi`
-   `future`
-   `Foreach`
-   Etc.

## The Parallel package

The `parallel` package is now part of the core distribution of R. It includes a number of different mechanisms to enable you to exploit parallelism utilizing the multiple cores in your processor(s) as well as compute the resources distributed across a network as a cluster of machines.

However, in this talk, we will stick to making the most of the resources available on the machine on which you are running R.

## Some steps {.smaller}

**How many cores do you have?**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load the package
library(parallel)
detectCores() 
```

**Starting clusters**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cl <- makeCluster(2) 
```

**Sending libraries to clusters**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
clusterEvalQ(cl, {
  library(tidyverse)
})
```

**Sending variables and functions to clusters**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 2
square <- function(num) num**2

clusterExport(cl, c("a", "square")) 

# To test if it was received I run another EvalQ
clusterEvalQ(cl, {
  print(c(a, square(a)))
})
```

**Stopping a cluster**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
stopCluster(cl)
```

## Example of time saved {.smaller}

Making the computer sleeps 3 sec before running anything, repeating this 5 times...

**Running in series**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ptm <- proc.time()
for (i in 1:5) Sys.sleep(3) 
print(proc.time()-ptm)
```

**Running in parallel**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(parallel)
ptm <- proc.time()
cl <- makeCluster(8) 
invisible(parSapply(cl, rep(3,5), Sys.sleep)) #invisible here just hides the null list from Sapply
stopCluster(cl)
print(proc.time()-ptm)
```

# Real example
